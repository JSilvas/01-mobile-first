# 01 Mobile First
**Author**: Jay Lina
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)
## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are implementing a mobile-first design using responsive web design techniques. We worked on the mobile design using hover and the desktop design as well.
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
We need to use live-server and we need to create the base, layout and modules css to separate the css in the app.
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using html and css, and media queries to create for different viewport sizes.
